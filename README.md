# Beam Example

A small sketchpad for Apache Beam pipelines with Python

It uses the [Belarus Used Cars Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/slavapasedko/belarus-used-cars-prices) Kaggle dataset to perform transform operations on its data and load it onto MongoDB Atlas

## Execution

Create a virtual environment and install the `apache_beam` and `dnspython` dependencies with PIP

Set the `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `DB_HOST` environment variables

Run the `main.py` script
